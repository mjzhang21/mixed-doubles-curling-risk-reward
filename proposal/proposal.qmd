Curling, nicknamed "chess on ice", is an official Winter Olympic sport
where two teams take turns sliding stones down a sheet of ice toward
a target known as the house. The team with the hammer-- the privilege of
throwing the final stone in an end-- has the strategic advantage, as they can 
react to the position and attempt to score multiple points.

Previous research has explored how posession of the "hammer" influences 
strategy and win probability. For example, @PARK2013391 find the posession 
of the hammer in the ninth end was more influential in determining the winner
of the game than in other ends. Additionally, an analysis of strategic 
decision shows that at the beginning
of the 10th end, it is preferable to be one point ahead without the
hammer than one point down with the hammer[@doi:10.1287/deca.1050.0032].

In this project, we focus on the defensive strategy in mixed
doubles curling, where the dynamics of play differ substantially from
traditional curling. In particular, we will examine the defense against
the power play, an option unique to mixed doubles that has received little
analytical attention. Understanding how the power play affects the optimal
behavior of the team without the hammer can provide new insights into 
risk-reward tradeoffs and decision-making in modern curling.


# Specific Aims

<!--
Formulate your research question; translate your research questions
into statistical/data science questions.
-->

The primary goal of this project is to analyze risk–reward trade-offs in 
mixed doubles curling, focusing on the decisions faced by the team without
 the hammer. Specifically, we aim to determine under which game states a 
 team should “punt” an end (play conservatively) versus attempt an aggressive
steal.

- How should the team without the hammer adjust its defensive strategy in 
  response to the opponent’s use of the power play to maximize expected win
   probability in mixed doubles curling?

## Supporting Questions

- How does the power play affect the probability that the team without the hammer
  successfully steals an end under different score differentials and end numbers?
- How does defensive response to the power play change the probability of giving 
  up multiple points in the end?
- Can we identify score differentials, end numbers, or stone placement scenarios 
  where the team without the hammer should switch from a conservative to aggressive 
  defensive strategy in response to a power play?

# Data


<!--
You should have identified the data needed for your project, instead
of stating that you will try to find some data. Give a description
about your data (source, coverage, key variables, structure, etc.) 
and justify its suitability for your research questions.
