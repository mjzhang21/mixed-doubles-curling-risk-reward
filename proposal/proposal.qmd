# Introduction

<!--
Background about your research; touch the three questions to be
addressed in an introduction (why do we care; what have been done;
what's new). 

Cite at least two references. 
Cite a reference in text: @agonafir2022machine did something.
Cite a reference in parenthesis: some interesting work has been done
[@agonafir2022understanding].

Curling, nicknamed Chess on Ice, is a popular official sport at the
Winter Olympics where two teams take turns sliding stones down a 
sheet of ice. In curling, the team which has the "hammer" throws the
last stone, allowing them to analyze the position and be at an
advantage. There have been several articles which dive into how having
the "hammer" influences strategy and win probability. For example,
@PARK2013391 finds the posession of hammer in the ninth end was 
more impactful in determining the winner of the game than other ends. 
Additionally, an analysis of strategic decision shows at the beginning
of the 10th end, it is better to be one point ahead without the
hammer than one point down with the hammer[@doi:10.1287/deca.1050.0032].


# Specific Aims

<!--
Formulate your research question; translate your research questions
into statistical/data science questions.
-->

# Data

<!--
You should have identified the data needed for your project, instead
of stating that you will try to find some data. Give a description
about your data (source, coverage, key variables, structure, etc.) 
and justify its suitability for your research questions.
-->


# Methods and Research Design

<!--
What design or methods will you use? Cite relevant references too if
needed [@agonafir2022machine; @agonafir2022understanding].
Show your thoughts on modeling, visualization, analysis,
prediction, validation, or other methodological issues you need
address in order to answer your scientific questions.
-->

# Discussion

<!--
What are the most challenge parts of the task? What are the
limitations of your work? What is your fall-back plan if something
unexpected happens?
