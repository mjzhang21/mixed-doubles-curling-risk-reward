# First Shot Defense of the Powerplay
    In mixed doubles curling, the powerplay can be played by the team with
the hammer once an end. In the default position, the preplaced stones
are placed with the hammer stone on top of the button and the non-hammer
stone as a guard. However in the powerplay, both stones are shifted
left or right, clearing the center-line of the board. Teams with the 
hammer or the last stone advantage typically win the end in regular
and powerplay ends. However, in regular ends, analysts have observed
mixed doubles is a game focused on execution. With the positioning
of the preplaced stones, most of the non-hammer team's success is 
determined by how well they execute their first shot, usually a draw
around the center guard. In the powerplay, there is much more variety in
how the non-hammer team plays the first shot of the end. Some common shots 
include a draw around the guard and tick shot which collides with the hammer
guard.
    While analysts have observed certain teams tend to apply different
shots when countering the powerplay, there is a lack of literature about the 
powerplay in general and the circumstances and effects playing certain shots
during a powerplay end. Thus, it is important to compare the different board 
positions and types of shots
