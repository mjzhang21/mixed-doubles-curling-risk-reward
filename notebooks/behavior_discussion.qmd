Differences in behavior are expected in Powerplay, and Powerplay behavior
potentially has a correlation with win probability.

On a stone-level, behavior predictors could include characteristics about the
shot itself, and also the game conditions before the shot. For example, a Guard
stone thrown by Team 1 in front of the button while Team 1 currently has 2 stones
in scoring position is certainly "Offensive" play; i.e., it solidies Team 1's lead.
Conversely, a Take-out thrown by Team 2 to remove one of Team 1's stones from scoring
position is certainly "Defensive" play as it seeks to reduce Team 1's scoring
potential.

# Behavior: Discussion

## Behavior: Definitions

I define curling behavior into three categories.

- **Offensive** "slow stones" focused on scoring and protecting what is already in
scoring positon. Draws, guards, etc. The goal is to score.
  - A.k.a. **aggresive** because this is risky behavior; no active focus
  on preventing opponent scoring can cost a big end and be a wasted opportunity
  - Guards being offensive is counterintuitive, but in curling, guards are usually
  meant to protect your scoring stones, not hinder your opponent from casting draws.
- **Defensive** "fast stones" focused on removing opponent stones in scoring position
and removing any guards which protect opponent scoring stones. The goal is to minimize
the opponent's score.
  - A.k.a. **conservative** because this is less risky behavior; this is a proactive
  risk-managment goal trying to prevent a huge end for the opponent
- **Probing** a sort of opportunistic behavior which is reactive to the opponent's
behavior. The team will play generally conservatively and cautiously (no risky skips)
waiting to see if later in the end, the conditions on the sheet warrant offensive or
defensive behavior. The goal is to wait until there are multiple stones on the ice
before deciding whether to be offensive or defensive.
  - From the curling literature, this behavior primarily exists to prevent accidents
  which cause large ends for the opponent, by not commiting to a sheet-setup early on.
  - This is an unconventional definition and actually does not exist in much curling
  documention (especially not for mixed-doubles), but I choose to include it because
  it is a bin for when no behavior is apparent; i.e., neutral (more on that later)

## Strategic Behavior

Curltech.com says that at the club and league level, the strategy is to
react and respond, i.e. play totally tactically: the strategy is no strategy.
Curltech.com also says that the strategy at the professional level is to
Plan, Execute, and Modify. From Curltech.com:

- Enter the game with an overarching strategy, based on opponent assessment.
  - Weaker opponent -> defensive strategy.
  - Stronger opponent -> offensive strategy.
  - Similar opponent -> opportunistic strategy.
- Structure your game (beginning, middle, and end).
  - Beginning -> Sparring
  - Middle -> Active Scoring
  - End -> Closing
- Decide an intended outcome for each end and **Execute** (the shot-calling, tactical part).
  - The most important part of execution is who has the hammer. This will influence
  shot-calling.
- Know when to switch [intended end outcome]. 

So in our data, which is collected from world championship and olympic level,
we should expect teams to play with a game-plan,
whether this is offensive-first, defensive-first, or probing-first.
To oversimplify, the curling coaches and analysts have decided that playing with
a strategy which favors a certain behavior is more effective than playing a purely
tactical game, i.e., focusing narrowly on selecting a specific shot rather than
thinking about how their shots fit into an overall plan.
So, the advantages of a behavioral strategy are
that the strategy dictates what shots you select, as opposed to an individual,
independent decision for every single one.

Of course, game-plan strategy is not binding. Teams must often adapt between ends
to a new and unexpected situation. For example, if they were playing with
a defense-first strategy, but they are nearing the end of the game and are behind in
points, it may be time to switch to offensive behavior to recoup. The transition
sequence for a very important variable, the hammer, is not guaranteed either,
so end goals are decided depending on which team has the hammer.
It is this end-level context which helps to inform teams what their intent for that
end will be, and consequently their observed behavior.

Professional players are able to adapt on a whim, sometimes even during an end. 
If the right opportunity presents itself, may shift their intended end outcome
if it will yield a better performance. Perhaps this is capitalizing on an opponent
mistake or remedying one of your own; behavior can absolutely be in multiple
places during the middle of the end. 

So, we know that "Behavior" is reflected in the shot-calling,
and that the intended
behavior is not only selected purely on the current sheet state (tactical), but also a
strategy which should (at least loosely) be apparent during the game and end.
E.g., setting a guard is offensive in nature and is part of an offense-first 
game-strategy, especially if the team is weaker and behind in score.

Suffice to say, behavior looks like:

- Game-plan strategy, which informs:
- End-goal strategy, which informs:
- Ice sheet situation, which informs:
- The next shot to call, which is our most granular observation of behavior.

That hierarchy isn't strictly downward flowing, because curling is
chronological and ends are not independent. For example a set of tactical
decision made in one end is going to effect the end-goal strategy of the next.
This is a limitation I will have to discuss later.

## Mixed Doubles Behavior

Now is a good time to mention that all of the previous conservation derives from
traditional four-player curling. The novelty of mixed doubles means there is little
data present to work with. This is actually the point of the Connecticut Sports
Analytics Symposium 2026 Data Challenge.

That is not to say that the latter conversation is useless, but just to note that
the only resources we have for Mixed Doubles curling strategy relies on strategy
developed in the traditional game. If we eventually observe behavior that's not
quite in-line with the previous discussion, we shouldn't be surprised.

What we can ascertain is that the typical classes of shot behavior are the same; the
game is not so totally different that the goal of each shot task is different
from the traditional game.

Mixed Doubles Curling was developed upon request by the IOC for a more interesting,
dynamic, and high-risk variant of curling that is less likely to fall into specific
patterns determined by a game strategy. 

The unique rules of mixed-doubles including the MFGZ, pre-placed stones,
the hammer being transferred even on
a blank (as opposed to retained in traditional), only 8 ends,
and of course the existence of the
power play, introduce new and unexplored strategic and tactical decisionmaking
(and hence, behavior).
The aforementioned unique rules are intended
to cause more stones to be in play and also necessitate more tactical decisonmaking
than the traditional game, one of the IOC's goals.

CurlTech notes:

- The game is played primarily in the four foot area making repeatable draw
weight key to Mixed Doubles.
  - *Our curlit data reflects this with most shots being Draws.*
  - *This is probably due to the MFGZ.*
- Most teams play the situation.
  - NHT typically opens with a Draw to the four foot, with the perfect shot being directly
  on the button.
  - HT responds with a draw to the four foot.
  - This builds a cluster directly in the house which continues until a team decides
  there is a good opportunity and reason to break up the cluster. MFGZ specifies
  takeouts can only begin with the 4th stone. 

An analyst from Rocks Across the Pond confirms that it is draw-heavy and calls it
significantly less strategic. Basically, "it's a race to the button" until something
interesting (like a mistake) happens and either team must react accordingly.

The data composition and analysts thus confirm that Mixed doubles is a less strategic
game. 
This fits mostly in-line with our defintion of probing behavior, which is designed
to become offensive or defensive depending on what happens.

So when analyzing behavior in mixed doubles curling, we may expect to see less
trends across games and ends due to the absence of strategy. 

We don't have a traditional curling dataset to compare to though, so this is not
something I will test.

### The Powerplay

The explicit goal of the Data Challenge is to focus
specifically on the Power play, where no data-driven strategy has really been
developed.

The powerplay is one result of the IOC's request for a more interesting game.
Once per game, each team, if they have the hammer, can elect to move the pre-placed stones
to the side, providing a clear sheet as is seen in the traditional game. This new
situation requires a different tactical approach, and can be exploited in various
ways to various ends. The power play end is typically more dynamic for this reason.
The original intent of the powerplay was that with a clear sheet, offensive behavior
would be easier, leading to more stones in play. As we will see, this isn't necessarily
the result.

The complete lack of data analysis for powerplay (hence the origin of the data challenge)
leaves much ambiguous in the scope of powerplay. How, if it all, is it used strategically?
Do strategies exist yet? Are teams using it with any strategy at all? Is it radically
alterinng the course of the game? No one, even the curling NOCs, has anything concrete
to say about the Power play.

As expected, the sources on power play behavior are sparse and sometimes contradict.
CurlTech says there are two reasons to choose a powerplay:

1. The hammer team needs or wants to
score two.
2. The hammer team is preventing a steal by keeping the center of the
sheet open. 

From Rocks Across the Pond:

- Power play is typically invoked near the end of the game and in a defensive manner. 
- Power play is not used early precisely due to the lack of data confirming whether or not
this is a good idea; teams are scared to experiment.

So, analysts only have intuition to work with. I could find only a few plausible strategies
for invoking the Power play:

- The HT is winning by a such a margin that they use the opportunity to keep the
score gap wide by playing a very defensive end.
- The HT is winning by such a margin that they see it low-risk to play an offensive
end widen the score gap.
- The HT is losing by such a margin that they use the opportunity to prevent the score
gap from widening by playing a defensive end.
- The HT is losing by such a margin that they see a high-risk high-reward opportunity
to play an offensive end and close the score gap. 

All of those scenarios are, by definition, strategic. This is counterintutive, but it seems
to me that the power play ends are the most strategic part of mixed doubles, as the hammer
team invokes power play specifically to meet an end-goal. This makes sense; the opening of the
sheet mimics traditional curling where it is easier 

And of course, NHT behavior is going to be different in the power play end as well,
but their behavior is not necessarily as strategically-motivated
because they are not the ones invoking
power play. *In fact I could not find a single source discussing response to powerplay as
a strategy, which is another important point to consider. I will only
observe NHT behavior during power play but do not seek to make any strategic recommendations
here; that is outside the scope of my analysis and will be handled by research partner
in a seperate accompanying analysis which is focused specifically on strategy recommendations
for NHT power play response.*

### Power Play Questions

So, I will grant that using power play is inherently a strategic decision,
because it allows for an end-objective to be set up. I define **power play behavior**
as the behavior present during a power play end. 

In no particular order, we need to answer:

- When and under what circumstances is power play invoked?
  - Does the other team having their power play impact this decision?
- What does HT behavior look like during a power play end?
  - Does this depend on Q1?
  - Are there any strategies revealed here?

### Testable Hypotheses (First Pass)

These are framed to be directly testable with the end-level features built later.

- **H1 (Power play shifts behavior):** Hammer teams show a higher offensive-rate
  during power play ends than during non-power play ends, conditional on end number
  and pre-end score differential.
- **H2 (Power play timing):** Power play is invoked more often when the hammer team
  is trailing or within one point (|pre_end_score_diff| <= 1) than when leading by
  two or more.
- **H3 (Behavior vs points in PP):** Within power play ends, higher offensive-rate
  is associated with higher hammer-team end points (Result), while higher defensive-rate
  is associated with lower variance in end points.
- **H4 (Context dependence):** In non-power play ends, the relationship between
  pre-end score differential and behavior (offensive vs defensive rates) is stronger
  than in power play ends.
- What does NHT behavior look like during a power play end?
  - Does this depend on Q1?
  - Are there any strategies revealed here?
- Can we confirm the analysts' intuition in when and how powerplay is being used?
  - E.g., is power play really used in the final end in a defensive manner?
- Can our power play analysis inform any new strategic decision making?



# Express Goals

## Behavior Classifcation

First,
what is easy to do with our existing data without new feature engineering is find out
when powerplay is used. We have histograms and crosstabs for that. 

Second, I need to classify behavior, easier said than done.

While it may feel intuitive to classify behavior off of shot-type,
the shot-type data (especially during power play) may prove too granular and noisy
to reliably classify. Shot-type is a very strong informer of intended behavior but
not the complete determinant. 

One alternative is by end-intent in two sections: for the first three stones (where take-outs
are not allowed) and for the last seven stones (where take-outs are allowed). I.e., before
and after Modified Free Guard Zone (MFGZ). I keep the 4-shot split as a sensitivity check.

I want to lean towards keeping the predictor set
smaller here, careful not to introduce categorical variables which could introduce leakage
or change the structure of the data. For example, even though I have identified strategy
as something that exists at the team-level, I think adding TeamID as a predictor for classifying
behavior (the idea would be its a fixed effect or something, because due to coaching
some teams are inherently more offensive/defensive than others) is too complicated for now. 

We want to see **Offense, Defense, and Probing**.
**Offensive** shots are typically defined as all of the slow stones, being:

- Draw (0)
- Front (1)
- Guard (2)
- Raise / Tap-back (3)
- Wick (4)
- Freeze (5)

These are all carefully placed stones aimed for scoring position and to guard
stones already in scoring position.

**Defensive** shots are typically defined as all of the fast stones, being: 

- Take-out (6)
- Hit and roll (7)
- Clearing (8)
- Double take-out (9)
- Promotion take-out (10)

These are high energy stones usually intended to remove a scoring stone or guard from play.

After that, I'd need to classify the same behavior during powerplay (special subset). 
Then observe Powerplay behaviors. Somehow quantify behavior in these ends.

Finally, I can then answer: How is powerplay used (what behaviors are present)

Next, what else can be observed from when and how powerplay is used? Can we tie this
to expected win probabilities, etc? Expected points? Do certain teams follow trends
in how and when they choose to invoke their powerplay?

# Findings (Current Run)

This section summarizes what the current intent-classification pipeline actually
shows. It uses phase-aware end labels (early vs late), a two-class late-phase
intent label (offensive vs defensive), and unsupervised clustering without
power-play leakage.

## Confirmed (or strongly supported)

- **Power play ends shift defensive.** End-level results show a clear shift
  toward defensive intent during power play ends compared to non-power play.
  Rule-based intent: offensive 80.6% -> 63.6%, defensive 19.4% -> 36.4%.
  Cluster intent: offensive 66.0% -> 45.7%, defensive 34.0% -> 54.3%.
- **Late-phase behavior separates intent.** Early phase is mostly offensive across
  ends (early offense 0.984 vs 0.895), while late phase determines the label
  (late offense 0.800 vs 0.192 and late defense 0.194 vs 0.796).

## Partially supported or mixed

- **H1 (hammer teams more offensive in PP):** Not supported. Hammer-only PP vs non-PP
  is similar under rule-based intent (offensive 76.9% vs 72.4%), and remains
  slightly defensive under clustering (51.6% vs 53.3% defensive).
- **"Power play is the strategic end":** PP ends are more defensive by both labels,
  but this does not directly measure strategic intent; it only reflects late-phase
  shot choice.

## Not yet tested

- **H2 (PP timing vs score diff):** Not tested here.
- **H3 (behavior vs end points in PP):** Not tested here.
- **H4 (context dependence):** Not tested here.
- **NHT behavior during PP:** Not tested here.

## Caveats

- Late-phase intent is a two-class simplification; mixed ends are forced into one class.
- PP is defined per end; clustering excludes PP to avoid leakage, then compares PP rates.
- A few ends have 4 or 6 shots per team; they do not change the aggregate results.

## Interpretation (Current Run)

The clearest signal is that power play ends look *more defensive* than non‑power‑play
ends once we focus on the late phase. The rule‑based labels show a large shift
from 19.4% defensive (non‑PP) to 36.4% defensive (PP), and the cluster labels show
the same direction (34.0% -> 54.3% defensive). This is consistent with the analysts'
intuition that power play does not simply amplify offense; it often coincides with
late‑phase defensive shot selection.

The mechanism seems to be *late‑phase choice*, not early‑phase behavior. Early
phase remains mostly offensive in both classes (0.984 vs 0.895 early‑offense rates),
which fits the MFGZ constraint. The late phase is where intents separate sharply
(late offense 0.800 vs 0.192; late defense 0.194 vs 0.796), so the shift is about
what teams do once takeouts are allowed.

The hammer‑only shifts are smaller than the aggregate shifts. Under rule‑based intent,
hammer teams move only slightly toward defense during PP (76.9% -> 72.4% offensive).
Under clustering, hammer rows stay near‑even but still tilt defensive (51.6% -> 53.3%
defensive). This suggests that much of the PP defensive swing may be coming from the
non‑hammer response or end‑level context rather than the hammer team alone.

Clustering adds structure: one small, strongly defensive cluster is heavily PP‑linked
(PP incidence ~0.80) and has positive pre‑end score differential (mean ~2.34), which
is consistent with a "protect a lead" pattern. The larger offensive cluster has low
PP incidence, which reinforces that PP is not simply used to chase offense.

Robustness checks do not change the story. The 4‑shot sensitivity split still shows
the same directional shift (29.0% -> 43.4% defensive), and the late‑offense threshold
grid is stable. So the defensive PP signal is not an artifact of the early/late cutoff.

Interpretation wise, the data support this framing: *power play ends are more likely
to be played defensively in the late phase*, even if the rule intent was offensive.
That could mean power play is invoked in defensive contexts (score, end, or match state),
or that opponents force a defensive reaction once PP is called. The next step to nail
mechanism is the hypothesis block: PP timing vs score diff (H2), within‑PP scoring
associations (H3), and context dependence (H4).
