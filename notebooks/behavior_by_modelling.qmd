The final plan.

# Buld the analysis unit: team-end

A new dataframe must be constructed which creates exactly two rows per
match_id and end_id; one for team_id1 and one for team_id2.
Each observational unit (so for each time) is intended to quantify the
decisions made by each team during the end without using every single
shot-row (too granular, useless).

The outcome is to see how much each team changed the sheet over the end,
not what did the shooter do on one shot (stone-level).

We will do this by taking the set of unique ends (match_id, end_id) and
cross-joining with {team_id1, team_id2}
