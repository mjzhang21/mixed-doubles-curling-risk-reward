*This data dictionary is for the master working dataframe* `stones_master_1.csv`. *Some notes about data quirks are also
included.*

```{python}
import pandas as pd
stones_master = pd.read_csv('../data/stones_master_1.csv')
stones_master.head()
```

This dataframe contains shot-by-shot level information as well
as some game and end level context attached.

- `MatchID` - unique ID for each Match in the dataset.
- `EndID` - ID for an end of the match. 8 ends are typical
in mixed doubles curling, but concession can lead to only 6
or 7 ends being played and overtime can lead to a 9th.
- `ShotID` - ID for the shot. Within a particular match and end, shots occur in ascending order of the ShotID values (i.e. lower
ShotIDs are thrown first).
    - `ShotID` begins at 7 and ascends to 22, skipping 10 through
    15.
    - My understanding is that 10-15 are unused "shot slots" from
    traditional 16 shot curling, and this is an artifact from curlit.
- `TeamID` - ID for the Team which threw the shot for the row.
    - This should take value 1 or 2 but has 5 instances of value 3.
    Curlit says this is a data entry error.
- Task - The type of shot that the player is throwing,
or the objective of the shot.
    - "-1": Shot not attempted due to concession.
    - "0": "Draw"
        - Meant to be for scoring position; close proximity to the
        button
    - "1": "Front"
        - Most likely front guard, i.e., guard placed in front of the
        house to protect stones and blockopponents.
    - "2": "Guard"
        - Meant to protect stones in curling position. Typically stop short of button
        to protect scoring stones.
    - "3": "Raise / Tap-back"
        - Throw pushes another stone forward into a new position. I.e., this
        moves a stone already in play with the new stone.
    - "4": "Wick / Soft peeling"
        - Light contact shot where by just grazing another stone, there's
        a slight direction change in the stone. Useful for bypassing guards, etc.
    - "5": "Freeze"
        - Form of draw which stops right in front of another stone. This makes it
        more difficult for the opponents to remove.
    - "6":
