abstract = {Curling is a winter sport played by over one million people in at least 33 countries. As with other sports, strategy and teamwork play an important role in winning a curling game. Various strategies, such as when you have (or don’t have) the last stone, can be applied based on the situations. In curling games, it is widely known that the team throwing the last stone in the opening end is likely to win. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the outcome of the game based on the possession of first stone or last stone per end. For the analysis, data was collected from statistics and results of the WCF (World Curling Federation). 628 games (309 men's games and 319 women's games) which ended exactly at the tenth end were used. Binary logistic regression in SPSS 20.0 was applied for the analysis. A dependent variable was the game outcome, and ten independent variables were the possessions of the last stone per end. As a result, it is found that there was a statistical significance (p< 0.05) between the game outcome and the possession of the last stone from the first end to the tenth end, except the second end. Specifically, the possession of the first or last stone in the ninth end was more closely related to winning the game than other ends.}

abstract = { We apply decision analysis to an important decision in the sport of curling. In particular, we examine the choice between taking a single point or blanking an end in the latter stages of a curling game. There are benefits and drawbacks associated with each alternative. Taking a single point provides the team with an additional point but transfers the last-shot advantage to the opposition. Blanking an end foregoes an additional point but retains the last-shot advantage. Based on the observation of world-class competitions, North American curlers will always attempt to blank an end, while their European counterparts have been known to opt for the single point. We develop a decision tree to conceptualize the choices. Then, we use data from over 900 national championship curling games to empirically determine the expected values of each alternative. Our results indicate that blanking the end is the better alternative. }
